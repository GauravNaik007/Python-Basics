        "  -  In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and execute\n",
        "     Python code line by line.\n",
        "  -  It translates the high-level code into machine-readable bytecode,\n",
        "     and then executes the bytecode.\n",
        "  -  Unlike compilers that translate the entire code into machine code\n",

        " - In Python, lists are mutable, which means their contents can be changed after they are created. We can add, remove, or modify elements in a list. This is because lists are designed for situations where the data might need to be updated frequently.\n",

        "- On the other hand, tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. We cannot add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple. This immutability makes tuples useful for storing fixed data that should not be altered, such as constants or values used as dictionary keys.\n",
